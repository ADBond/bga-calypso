# Calypso for BGA

For devvy stuff check out [dev notes](./misc/dev.md).

## Current branch to-do list

a fluid list to remember what needs to be done before pulling in and starting a new chunk of work

* everything remaining in this file - mostly code tidying

## To-do list

Loosely split into core logic stuff and more nicities, but obviously some overlap. Archived items in [an archive](./misc/archive.md)

### Logic

* ~~anything else in [gathered list of to-dos](./misc/todo_list) from code not covered by these/general tidying~~

### Dev

* ~~have at least a proper go-through of code to tidy at least a _little_~~
* ~~Add a separate code licence~~, and make repo public once that's done
* ~~Use game-level constants in place of magic numbers where possible~~
  * in todo/part of general refactoring. on my radar
* ~~`global` trick can now be killed in favour of `use` which is much nicer~~
  * this is in todo list now - only one instance of it but want to check once it's done

### Things to test

* ~~check score table game end refresh~~

### Meta

* ~~anything to adjust in gameinfos - particularly revise description & and tags, and durations~~

### Misc

* ~~Check timings - don't get extra on trick lead :/~~
