# Calypso game description

rough but need to start somewhere to refine

Calypso is a forgotten classic card game from Trinidad.
Four players play in partnerships, each having their own unique trump suit.
Players aim to win tricks containing cards of their own trump suit, to form calypsos,
which are runs of the thirteen ranks, whilst preventing their opponents from doing the same.

Described as catering to fans of both Bridge and Canasta
