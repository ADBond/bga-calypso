# Calypso game description

Calypso is a somewhat forgotten card game, originating in Trinidad in the 1950s.
Described as combining elements of bridge and canasta, four players play in fixed partnerships, with each player possessing their own personal trump suit.
Played with four identical fifty-two card packs, the aim is to win tricks containing cards of their partnership's suits to complete Calypsos - sequences of a single card of every rank in their suit, over the course of a round of four deals, whilst attempting to prevent their opponents from doing the same.
