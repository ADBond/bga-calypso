# Future

Some things to maybe add in, depending how things go

### Logic

* player preference for auto-confirm new round
  * not for alpha (NFA)

### Display

* ~~Order hand with personal trumps separated?~~
  * NFA
* trick-pile/(calypso - ~~though think it's irrelevant here~~) show small grey bits in corners?
  * slight border round face-down cards? (to distinguish calypsopile) - needs separation above so that we don't have round corners
  * NFA
* rotate cards in-transit? just a _teeny_ bit jarring when asymmetric cards (e.g. A hearts) arrive from opposite
  * NFA
* specialise renounce-flag tooltips to player/suit?
* ~~customised table colours (for people who don't like purple as much as I do :( )?~~

* Nicer cards & four-colour options - see file Jimble sent via cribbage
* Player names link to profiles?

### Variants

* Seems to be enough around of 'beat the leader' to include as a variant. Maybe doesn't need to be done for alpha though
  * (i.e. trumping in to trump lead must be higher. Rule as it stands seems better to me, but nice to have both, not in too much danger of configuration hell here.)
  * NFA
