# Credits

Thanks to the BGA dev community for all the resources and for answering my questions when I was doing something stupid. I also owe credit in particular to the code of W. Michael Shirk's [Grosstarock implementation](https://github.com/wmichaelshirk/grosstarock) and Drasill's [Coinche](https://github.com/drasill/bga-coinche) which were both very useful to stare at when I was trying to understand the framework.

Additionally I have taken inspiration from the implementation of several great games available on BGA - in particular in addition to the above, [Hungarian Tarokk](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=hungariantarokk), [Solo Whist](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=solowhist), and [Phat](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=phat). Go play them, they are excellent!
